# HELYX-OS
[HELYX-OS](http://engys.com/products/helyx-os) is an open-source Graphical User Interface designed to work natively with OpenFOAM [version 2.4.0](http://www.openfoam.org/archive/2.4.0/download/source.php). The GUI is developed by [ENGYS](http://engys.com/) using Java+[VTK](http://www.vtk.org/) and delivered to the public under the GNU General Public License.
 
HELYX-OS has been created to facilitate the usage of the standard OpenFOAM libraries, by removing the complexity of text based case definition in favour of an intuitive easy-to-use graphical user interface. The GUI is focused on pre-processing tasks, including meshing, case definition and solver execution.
